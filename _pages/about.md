Ciao! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [**MLO Group**](https://mlo-lab.github.io/) lead by Prof. Florian Buettner at Goethe University Frankfurt (Germany). Prior to joining the group, I was granted a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions-ITN fellowship for my industrial doctorate in Computer Science at the [**University of Birmingham**](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/postgraduate-research) (UK) under the supervision of Prof. Peter Tiňo and Prof. Xin Yao. During this period, I was a full-time early-stage researcher at [**NEC Labs Europe**](https://neclab.eu/) (Heidelberg, Germany) in the Machine Learning group led by Prof. Mathias Niepert. I received my BSc in Statistics and my MSc in Data Science at Sapienza, University of Rome (Italy).

During my PhD, my research goal was to develop and discover new approaches and methods for increasing the **interpretability of** representation learning techniques and **black-box models**. Now, I am working on developing **trustworthy** solutions in **federated** and **continual learning** settings. The project is part of the [*OpenFLaaS (Open Federated Learning as a Service)*](https://openflaas.de/) consortium including several partners across Germany and funded by BMWk (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz).
